To write a program that will output the hostname in C#, create a sample .NET core app.
Create a class to display the hostname using the Dns.GetHostName() method in C# as seen below.
Use the â€œsystem.Net" namespace to get DNS record and System.Net.Sockets namespace for socket exceptions. (Note: try catch block was used to catch any exception).
